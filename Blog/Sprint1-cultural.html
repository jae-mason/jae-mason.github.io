      <p> Kia ora koutou, Ko Jae tooku ingoa, No Tamaki-Makaurau ahau, Kei Henderson ahau e noho ana.  
      Hello all, My name is Jae and I am from Auckland. I am currently living in Henderson.
      At the moment I am on a break from a 14 year career in the insurance industry and thought now is a great time or a career change and to do something I had a passion for prior to starting a family 19 years ago.
      I place a lot of value on my family as they mean the most to me - instilling the key values of whanaungatanga, kotahitanga, aroha, rangatiratanga and manaakitanga have been a huge part of my life until this point and will continue to be in the future. </p>
      
    <h2 class="subheading">My personality types, core personal values, strengths and limitations. </h2>
      
      <p> Based on the Myers Briggs and DOPE testing I am described in the following way. </p>
      
      <ul class="Ulist">
        <li>I = Introvert</li>
        <li>S = Sensing</li>
        <li>T = Thinking</li>
        <li>P = Perceiving</li>
      </ul>
      

      <p>I am a logical, quietly analytical, practical, adaptable, curious, cool, observer, problem solver, exact, realistic, troubleshooter, hands-on, variety, adventurous and independent.</p>
      
      <ul class="Ulist">
        <li>Owl =45%</li>
        <li>Dove = 35%</li>
        <li>Eagle = 15%</li>
        <li>Peacock = 5%</li>
       </ul> 
      
      <p>I am a logical, mathematically minded, methodical, perfectionist that loves details.
      However, I have low assertiveness and low emotionality.</p>
      
      <p>Others see me as dedicated, committed and persistent with a great sense of humour.</p>
      
      <p>There are two core personal values that are fundamental to me as an individual - integrity, and honesty.</p>
      
      <p>There was a time when I identified fraudulent transactions in my workspace. To my surprise they were undertaken by someone I considered a friend.  My ethics were on the line.  I had options to weigh up. Integrity and honesty or deceit and lies, this was a substantial theft.</p>  
      
      <p>Thinking personally about my cultural Maori values, and Tikanga, to always do things right, I believe these have made me a better person and helped me to make the right choices.  I had to report the fraud and request a full investigation into the theft. At the end of the day, it was not my burden to carry.</p>
      
      <p>My strengths really help with my personal learning development, especially when it's in an independent hands-on environment.  I like to expand my learning experience and stretch the topics the best I can.</p>
      
      <p>Career Development for me within the insurance claims profession was varied.  My personal values always had me expanding my knowledge and pushing myself to become the best I could be.  This resulted in me being a well respected, knowledgable and approachable team member. I do believe my lack of self-confidence and group speaking deficiencies have prevented me from further progressing my career into management.</p>

      <p>I believe one of my greatest strengths is being a problem solver, I should be able to find ways to overcome barriers along the way to becoming a great developer. </p>
