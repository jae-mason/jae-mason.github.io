    <h2 class="subheading"> Research Neuroplasticity </h2>
    <h3> <!--Date if required here--> </h3>
    
    <p> Neural - refers to the nervous system.
      Plasticity - The capacity to adapt or change.
       </p>
       <h2 class="subheading">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
    <p>Understanding these principles benefits people because they can start to learn about the brain's ability to change itself.
      Although habits are well-travelled pathways, it is possible to think differently and change these by rewiring our brains.</p>
      
      <P>Visualising what you are trying to achieve lights up the primary visual cortex. Imagining something influences the action because these functions are integrated and 1 influences the other.</P>
      
      <P>By practising something mentally the neuron connections are still being strengthened because they are being used. This is an effective way of preparing for any physical skill - each thought changes the structure and function of the brain by affecting neurons at a microscopic level.</P>
    
    <h2 class="subheading">Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
    <p>I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit by ensuring that I am in a learning environment that will generate successful outcomes (both physical surrounds as well as internally; mentally).</p>

      <P>Repetition, intensity and time of learning something new matters, so making sure to practice intently when my mind is at its most receptive.</P>
      
     <p> And finally making meaningful connections in the content to help improve retention of the information - putting it in context. By seeing the relationships between concepts to generate greater brain cell activity and achieve more successful long term memory storage and retrieval.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subheading">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>Some ways to increase my neuroplasticity might be to use it or lose it; failing to drive specific brain functions can lead to loss of abilities, so making sure to use it and improve it instead. By driving specific functions I can start to improve my abilities in the areas of focus.</p>

      <P>I can look for opportunities for transference - where a change in functions can lead to learning other similar skills. Also being mindful that the words we use to praise, coach and criticise others impact their association of the information being presented.</P>
      
      <P>And finally avoiding interference - where brain changes that result in bad habits can interfere with good learning habits.</P>

    <h2 class="subheading">Research Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</p>

      <P>Having a growth mindset (the belief that you are in control of your own ability, and can learn and improve) is the key to success.</P>
      
      <P>It is relevant to focus on what I can do to improve my ability rather than focus on how well I have or haven't done with a task.</P>
      
      <P> - In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</P>
      
      <P>Yes, you need to commit to developing a growth mindset. Hard work, effort, and persistence are important, but not as important as having the underlying belief that you are in control of your own destiny.
      
      Cultivating a growth mindset is so powerful that it could be the single most important thing that I do to achieve success.</P>
      
      <P> - How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</P>
      
      <P> I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey by not being afraid of failure and giving things a go and viewing setbacks as an opportunity to learn.
      
      <P>This will help me with trying even harder to overcome a problem.</P>

    <h2 class="subheading">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
    <p>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</p>

      <P>These understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy by learning and teaching others to develop and improve their abilities through the adoption of a growth mindset.</P>
      
     <P> This will be very empowering and help me take control of my learning. By being in control, this should result in better performance and successful learning outcomes.</P>
      
     <P>
       Recognising that mindsets are important for learning new skills and affect the way we think about everything, so I would also want to ensure that I reply to my fixed mindset with a growth mindset approach - telling me that I can learn.
