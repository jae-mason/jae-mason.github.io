    <h1 id="heading"> Learning Plan </h1>
    <h2 class="subheading"> What is your long term goal and or career pathway? </h2>
    <h3> <!--Date if required here--> </h3>
    
    <p> My long term goal or career pathway is to attain employment in the IT industry and eventually maybe running my own business to support others in business too. </p>
         
      <h2 class="subheading"> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? </h2>
            
      <p>The skills I would like to see developed in myself while at EDA is the belief in my capability to deliver on what is needed. By communicating, listening, asking questions and gaining an understanding of exactly that I think this can be achieved. </p>
      
      <h2 class="subheading"> A description of your own strengths and limitations </h2>
      
      <p> My strengths would include curiousity, problem solving, dedication and persistance.</p>
      
      <p>To me problem solving and curiousity run hand in hand. They have helped me overcome a number of challenges and situations in life.  
      I have always been curious when it comes to how things work and what makes them tick.
      I also believe dedication and persistance play a big part and work along side these as well.
      I have a strong internal battle when it comes to problem solving and hate walking away from anything I put my mind to. </p> 
      
      <p>The struggle is real being a perfectionist - my key limitation!!
      And I also have a problem with public speaking or even group speaking. I'm not exactly sure what it is but I tend to go into shutdown mode, forget what I'm talking about and lose all direction, go bright red and feel like the walls are closing in on me. </p>
        
      <h2 class="subheading"> My commitment of how I will manage my workload </h2> 
      <p>I think my strengths really help with my personal learning development, especially when its in an independant hands-on environment. I like to expand my learning experience and stretch 
      the topics the best I can.</p>
      
      <p> The foundations study has certainly taught me how not to manage myself during the bootcamp part of the programme. I will be looking to fully understand what needs to be achieved each week, work out how much time I need to committ to that and have a daily plan of tasks to track and then execute towards completion.</p>
      
      <p>Where there are dependencies on others I think having scheduled daily stand-ups will help assist us with monitoring progress with each other, seeing what is blocking someone from progressing and determining how we best support them to move forward.</p>
      
      <p>I believe one of my greatest strengths is being a problem solver, I should be able to find ways to overcome barriers along the way to becoming a great developer.</p>
      
      <h2 class="subheading"> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. </h2>
      
      <p> My commitment of how and where I will seek help in a timely way if assistance is needed throughout the day then I think time-boxing the period to self trouble shoot needs to be agreed (no more than 10 - 15 mins and then approach someone else.</p>
      
      <h2 class="subheading"> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team </h2>
      
      <p> My description of what I expect from te facilitation team is to be available to assist, pushback when the answer should be obvious, but also support or indicate if I am heading way off track. </p>
      
      <h2 class="subheading"> Any scheduling information </h2> 
        <p> Such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. </p>
      
      <p> My scheduling information (i.e. block out times at this stage are only 10th Jan - all day and 29th Jan - am only). Any others will be planned into each week to ensure impact to learning is not affected. </p>
