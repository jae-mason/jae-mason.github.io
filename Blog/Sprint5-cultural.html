    <h3> 3 new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning. </h3>
    
    <p> 1. Recognising the values that I stand by. I have not really called these out before. </p>
    <p> 2. That the term emotional intelligence exists as it is not one that I understood well before now. And that it relates to also being able to read people which is something I definitely realised that I have the skills to be able to do.</p>
    <p> 3. The power that my mindset has and that by developing a growth mindset I can shift from a fixed mindset.</p>
    
    <h3>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming</h3>
    
    <p>By having this information about yourself you can better understand others and work more cohesively in a collaborative environment together.</p>
    
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    
    <p>Seeing how I can learn new things about myself.</p>

    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</h3>

    <p>There are still some aspects that I think I need to practice to make it stick.</p>

    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development boot camp course?</h3>

    <p>To improve the people skills of a web development team member. My past interactions with people who have not focussed on this area of their development make it difficult to manage troubleshooting situations.</p>

    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

    <p>No, core learning has not been a waste of time. And I can see why this is just as important as learning the technical elements of the course.</p>
